### Mentions

1. You may probably need to install an anaconda environment which contains all packages followed.
    - pytorch                   1.9.0           py3.7_cuda10.2_cudnn7_0    pytorch
    - cudatoolkit               10.2.89              h74a9793_1
    - opencv-python             4.5.2.54                 pypi_0    pypi
    - visdom                    0.1.8.9                  pypi_0    pypi
    - yacs                      0.1.8                    pypi_0    pypi

2. For training, an NVIDIA GPU is strongly recommended for speed.


3. Before you run the codes for self-study or reappearance the performance in this paper **"CvT-ASSD"**,
please add the **CvT_SSD/model/** directory into sources Root caused by the reference of many codes 
inside of model directory 
   
4. you should download the pytorch parameters file postfix by ".pth" and move into **models/CvT/weights**
